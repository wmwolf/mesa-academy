On this page, you'll find an introduction to your author, a bit about the purpose of these tutorials, and some of the conventions used in these tutorials.

## About the Author

Hi my name is [Bill Wolf](https://billwolf.space). I'm an associate professor of physics and astronomy at the [University of Wisconsinâ€“Eau Claire](https://uwec.edu), where I teach and do research in computational astrophysics with a team of undergraduate researchers. I've been using MESA since 2012, and I've been a MESA develoepr since 2017. My research focuses on the evolution of accreting white dwarfs, but a lot of my work with MESA has been related to its [testing infrastructure](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJS..269...50W/abstract).

I've also been involved with most of the [MESA schools](https://mesastar.org/summer-schools/) since 2012, so I've had a lot of experience writing and facilitating MESA tutorials. I hope that this experience pays off for you in these tutorials and you're able to joing the ranks of MESA blackbelts world wide!

## About These Tutorials

A driving philosophy between these tutorials is that you should learn MESA by using it, not just by reading about it. Of course, you *do* need to read a bit about it, but I aim to keep you working on things constantly as you go. As such, each of the main tutorials is interspersed with **Tasks** that you should complete before moving on. Don't skip these! That's where the real learning happens.

The first example of a task is just below. Do it, and then mark it complete uskng the checkbox in the upper left. A summary of all tasks in a tutorial is present in the lower right sidebar (if your browser window is wide enough to show the right sidebar). Note that you can mark tasks complete by clicking on the checkbox next to a task in the sidebar. You can also click on a task name to scroll immediately to that task in the main content area.

<Task title="Read this Task" number={1} tutorialNumber={tutorialNumber}>
  This is an example of a task that you'll see throughout these tutorials. The title will give you a short command, and then the text in this box will give you more context or steps.
  
  Tasks might include:
  - Editing files
  - Executing commands
  - Searching the documentation
  - Exploring results
  
  Always complete these tasks before moving on to ensure you're getting the most out of these tutorials!
</Task>

In addition to Tasks, which are things you'll <em>do</em>, I've also laid out clear <strong>Learning Objectives</strong> in each tutorial. These are usually statements that start with "I can..." and describe <em>abilities</em> that you should have at various points throughout each tutorial. If you stumble across a learning objective that you don't think you have achieved yet, take a moment to go back and review the material or complete any unfinished tasks. When you feel you have achieved a learning objective, check it off in the associated box (first example just below). You should see the objective box turn green as well as the reminder in the summary at the top of the right side bar (if your browser window is wide enough to show the right sidebar).

<LearningObjective statement="understand the hands-on learning philosophy of MESA Academy" number={1} tutorialNumber={tutorialNumber} />

## Conventions and Organization

The tutorials are best viewed on a computer web browser, though they should also work on a tablet or phone. On a larger screen, you'll see a navigation menu in the upper left that lets you jump between the different tutorials and resources. In the lower left, you'll see a table of contents that lets you jump to different sections of the current tutorial. You can also use the search bar in the upper right to search for specific topics.

As mentioned above, a summary of learning objectives should be present in the upper right sidebar, and a summary of tasks in the lower right. These will only be visible if your browser window is wide enough.

In the main body (middle pane) of the tutorials, you'll see a lot of different types of content in addition to the tasks and learning objectives. Here's a brief overview of what you can expect:

### Hints
<Hint title="Click me for a hint.">
  If you get stuck on a task, look for a hint like this one. The title will give a vague indication of what the hint is about, and if you click on it to expand it, you'll see a more detailed hint.
</Hint>

### Answers
<Answer title="Click me for the answer.">
  If you really get stuck, or just want to check your work, you can click on an answer like this one to see the solution. However, I recommend trying to solve the task yourself first!

  Since an answer always is associated with a task, each answer also provides a checkbox at the bottom to mark the associated task as complete. It doesn't matter if you use this checkbox, the one on the task, or the one in the sidebar; they all do the same thing.
</Answer>

### Asides
Occasionally I'll provide additional information that is related, but not absolutely necessary to complete a task. These will be put in little "asides" like the examples below.

<Aside>
Some generic information that is not essential, but may be of interest.
</Aside>

<Aside type='caution'>
This is a cautionary aside. It might warn you about something that could cause minor issues or lead to bad habits if not heeded.
</Aside>

<Aside type="danger">
This is a danger aside. It might alert you to something that could more immediately cause significant issues if not heeded.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
This is a tip aside. It might provide you with a useful shortcut or trick that will make your life easier.
</Aside>

### Code blocks
Of course, you'll be seeing a lot of code blocks throughout these guiedes. A basic code block looks like this:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

Note that code blocks always have a handy copy button in the upper right corner that becomes visible when your mouse enters the code block. If code belongs in a particular file, I'll indicate that in the code block header. For example, if this code belongs in a file called `hello.py`, it will look like this:

```python
# hello.py
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

Commands that you should run in a terminal will appear in in what's meant to look like a little terminal window, like this:

```bash
# Run this command in your terminal
echo $MESA_DIR
```

I may highlight specific lines in a block to draw your attention to them. For example, in the code block below, the line `echo $MESA_DIR` is highlighted:

```zsh {2}
# Run this command in your terminal
echo $MESA_DIR
echo `mesasdk_version`
```

or I may highlight individual words within a line, like how `/path/to/work/directory/` is highlighted below, potentially indicating that you should replace it with code more appropriate for your system or something new or important to pay attention to:

```bash "/path/to/work/directory"
cp -r $MESA_DIR/work /path/to/work/directory
cd /path/to/work/directory
./mk && ./rn
```

Finally, I may highlight lines that should be removed or added to a file, like this. Lines to remove will be highlighted in red and have a minus sign (`-`) in front of them, while lines to add will be highlighted in green and have a plus sign (`+`) in front of them:

```diff lang="fortran" title='inlist_project'
  initial_mass = 1.0d0

```diff lang="fortran"
  initial_mass = 1.0d0
- stop_near_zams = .true.
+ xa_central_lower_limit_species(1) = 'h1'
+ xa_central_lower_limit(1) = 1d-3
```

In this example, the line `stop_near_zams = .true.` should be removed, and the two lines starting with `xa_central_lower_limit_species(1)` and `xa_central_lower_limit(1)` should be added.
