# Task Component Example

This page demonstrates how to use the Task component with guide number from frontmatter.

## Basic Usage

<Task title="Clone the repository" number={1} guideNumber={guideNumber}>
  First, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/example/repo.git
  cd repo
  ```
</Task>

<Task title="Install dependencies" number={2} guideNumber={guideNumber}>
  Now install the required dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

  Make sure all dependencies are installed correctly before proceeding.
</Task>

<Task title="Run the development server" number={3} guideNumber={guideNumber}>
  You can now start the development server:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

  Visit http://localhost:3000 to see your application running.
  
  The Task component supports various content elements:
  
  * List items
  * Multiple paragraphs
  * Code blocks
  * And more!
</Task>

## Guide-specific Numbering

You can override the guide number by providing a different value:

<Task title="Guide-specific example" number={4} guideNumber="2">
  This task will show as "Task 2.4" since we've explicitly set guideNumber="2",
  which overrides the page's frontmatter guideNumber.
</Task>

## Manual Numbering

<Task title="Custom numbered task" number={10}>
  This task has a manually set number (10) and inherits guide number 0 from the frontmatter.
</Task>
