On this page, you'll find an introduction to your author, a bit about the purpose of these tutorials, and some of the conventions used in these tutorials.

## About the Author

Hi my name is [Bill Wolf](https://billwolf.space). I'm an associate professor of physics and astronomy at the [University of Wisconsinâ€“Eau Claire](https://uwec.edu), where I teach and do research in computational astrophysics with a team of undergraduate researchers. I've been using MESA since 2012, and I've been a MESA develoepr since 2017. My research focuses on the evolution of accreting white dwarfs, but a lot of my work with MESA has been related to its [testing infrastructure](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJS..269...50W/abstract).

I've also been involved with most of the [MESA schools](https://mesastar.org/summer-schools/) since 2012, so I've had a lot of experience writing and facilitating MESA tutorials. I hope that this experience pays off for you in these tutorials and you're able to joing the ranks of MESA blackbelts world wide!

## About These Tutorials

A driving philosophy between these guies is that you should learn MESA by using it, not just by reading about it. Of course, you *do* need to read a bit about it, but I aim to keep you working on things constantly as you go. As such, each of the main tutorials is interspersed with **Tasks** that you should complete before moving on. Don't skip these! That's where the real learning happens.

## Acknowledgements

These tutorials were written with support from the National Science Foundation under grant AST-2238851. Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in these materials are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.

Additionally, I adapted and updated many exercises in these tutorials from exercises in various [MESA Schools](https://mesastar.org/summer-schools/). When this is the case, I'll cite the original source exercise.

## Conventions and Organization

The tutorials are best viewed on a computer web browser, though they should also work on a tablet or phone. In the upper left, you'll see a navigation menu that let's you jump between the different tutorials and resources. In the upper right, you'll see a table of contents that lets you jump to different sections of the current tutorial. You can also use the search bar in the upper right to search for specific topics.

In the main body of the tutorials, you'll see a lot of different types of content:

### Tasks

<Task title="Read this Task" number={1} guideNumber={guideNumber}>
  This is an example of a task that you'll see throughout these tutorials. The title will give you a short command, and then the text in this box will give you more contex or steps.
  
  Tasks might include:
  - Editing files
  - Executing commands
  - Searching the documentation
  - Exploring results
  
  Always complete these tasks before moving on to ensure you're getting the most out of these tutorials!
</Task>

### Hints
<Hint title="Click me for a hint.">
  If you get stuck on a task, look for a hint like this one. The title will give a vague indication of what the hint is about, and if you click on it to expand it, you'll see a more detailed hint.
</Hint>

### Answers
<Answer title="Click me for the answer.">
  If you really get stuck, or just want to check your work, you can click on an answer like this one to see the solution. However, I recommend trying to solve the task yourself first!
</Answer>

### Asides
Occasionally I'll provide additional information that is related, but not absolutely necessary to complete a task. These will be put in little "asides" like the examples below.

<Aside>
Some generic information that is not essential, but may be of interest.
</Aside>

<Aside type='caution'>
This is a cautionary aside. It might warn you about something that could cause minor issues or lead to bad habits if not heeded.
</Aside>

<Aside type="danger">
This is a danger aside. It might alert you to something that could more immediately cause significant issues if not heeded.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
This is a tip aside. It might provide you with a useful shortcut or trick that will make your life easier.
</Aside>

### Code blocks
Of course, you'll be seeing a lot of code blocks throughout these guiedes. A basic code block looks like this:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

Note that code blocks always have a handy copy button in the upper right corner. If code belongs in a particular file, I'll indicate that in the code block header. For example, if this code belongs in a file called `hello.py`, it will look like this:

```python
# hello.py
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

Commands that you should run in a terminal will appear in in what's meant to look like a little terminal window, like this:

```bash
# Run this command in your terminal
echo $MESA_DIR
```

I may highlight specific lines in a block to draw your attention to them. For example, in the code block below, the line `echo $MESA_DIR` is highlighted:

```zsh {2}
# Run this command in your terminal
echo $MESA_DIR
echo `mesasdk_version`
```

or I may highlight individual words within a line, like how `/path/to/work/directory/` is highlighted below, potentially indicating that you should replace it with code more appropriate for your system or something new or important to pay attention to:

```bash "/path/to/work/directory"
cp -r $MESA_DIR/work /path/to/work/directory
cd /path/to/work/directory
./mk && ./rn
```

Finally, I may highlight lines that should be removed or added to a file, like this. Lines to remove will be highlighted in red and have a minus sign (`-`) in front of them, while lines to add will be highlighted in green and have a plus sign (`+`) in front of them:

```diff lang="fortran" title='inlist_project'
  initial_mass = 1.0d0

```diff lang="fortran"
  initial_mass = 1.0d0
- stop_near_zams = .true.
+ xa_central_lower_limit_species(1) = 'h1'
+ xa_central_lower_limit(1) = 1d-3
```

In this example, the line `stop_near_zams = .true.` should be removed, and the two lines starting with `xa_central_lower_limit_species(1)` and `xa_central_lower_limit(1)` should be added.
