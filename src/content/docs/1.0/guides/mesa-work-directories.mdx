MESA is installed and set up, so now it's time to learn about the structure of MESA and MESA work directories.

## Structure of `$MESA_DIR`
Before we run a simulation, let's go through some basic structure of your MESA installation.

<Task title="Navigate to and explore your MESA installation" number={1} guideNumber={guideNumber}>
  Open a terminal and navigate to your MESA installation directory. This is the directory where you cloned the MESA repository. This task will also check to see if you <em>really</em> got your MESA installation set up correctly. Once in your directory, run the command `ls --color=auto` to list the contents of the directory.
</Task>
<Hint title="Use an environment variable.">
  You can use the `MESA_DIR` environment variable to quickly navigate to your MESA installation directory.
</Hint>
<Answer>
    If you set up your `MESA_DIR` envrionment variable correctly, you can use the following command to navigate to your MESA installation directory:
    ```bash
    cd $MESA_DIR
    ls --color=auto
    ```
    <Aside type='caution'>
  If you get an error that `$MESA_DIR` is not set, you need to set it up. Go back to the [prerequisites and setup guide](/docs/guides/prerequisites-and-setup) and ensure you've correctly installed MESA and set the appropriate environment variables, notably `MESA_DIR`, `MESASDK_ROOT`, and `OMP_NUM_THREADS`.

<Aside type="tip">
  The `--color=auto` option will colorize the output of `ls`, making it easier to distinguish between files and directories. I recommend aliasing `ls` to `ls --color=auto` in your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) for convenience.

## Working with MESA work directories

The key concept in MESA is the **work directory**. This is where you set up and run your stellar evolution simulations. MESA provides template work directories that you copy and customize for your specific research needs.

This guide covers the essential concepts you need to understand MESA's structure and get started with your first simulation.
