On this page, you'll find an introduction to your author, a bit about the purpose of these guides, and some of the conventions used in these guides.

## About the Author

Hi my name is [Bill Wolf](https://billwolf.space). I'm an associate professor of physics and astronomy at the [University of Wisconsinâ€“Eau Claire](https://uwec.edu), where I teach and do research in computational astrophysics with a team of undergraduate researchers. I've been using MESA since 2012, and I've been a MESA develoepr since 2017. My research focuses on the evolution of accreting white dwarfs, but a lot of my work with MESA has been related to its [testing infrastructure](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJS..269...50W/abstract).

I've also been involved with most of the MESA schools since 2012, so I've had a lot of experience writing and facilitating MESA tutorials. I hope that this experience pays off for you in these guides and you're able to joing the ranks of MESA blackbelts world wide!

## About These Guides

A driving philosophy between these guies is that you should learn MESA by using it, not just by reading about it. Of course, you *do* need to read a bit about it, but I aim to keep you working on things constantly as you go. At times. As such, each of the main guides is interspersed with **Tasks** that you should complete before moving on. Don't skip these! That's where the real learning happens.

## Acknowledgements

These guides were written with support from the National Science Foundation under grant AST-2238851. Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in these materials are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.

Additionally, I adapted and updated many exercises in these guides from exercises in various [MESA Schools](https://mesastar.org/summer-schools/). When this is the case, I'll cite the original source exercise.

## Conventions and Organization Used in These Guides

The guides are best viewed on a computer web browser, though they should also work on a tablet or phone. In the upper left, you'll see a navigation menu that let's you jump between the different guides and resources. In the upper right, you'll see a table of contents that lets you jump to different sections of the current guide. You can also use the search bar in the upper right to search for specific topics.

In the main body of the guides, you'll see a lot of different types of content:

### Tasks

<Task title="Read this Task" number={1} guideNumber={guideNumber}>
  This is an example of a task that you'll see throughout these guides. The title will give you a short command, and then the text in this box will give you more contex or steps.

  Tasks might include:

  * Editing files
  * Executing commands
  * Searching the documentation
  * Exploring results

  Always complete these tasks before moving on to ensure you're getting the most out of these guides!
