## Important Notes

- **Progress Isolation**: The most critical step is updating the `getCurrentVersion()` function. Failure to do this will cause progress from the previous "latest" version to bleed into the new version.

- **Testing Priority**: Focus testing on the interactive features (Tasks, LearningObjectives, sidebar progress) as these are the most complex parts of the system.

- **Rollback Plan**: Keep the previous version's configuration handy in case a rollback is needed.
